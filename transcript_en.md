So, er, hi again.\
I'll\
So this is the second part, I guess, I'll\
It would be great to have a discussion afterwards if you have questions, if you have things you'd like to try out.\
I'm going to talk a bit about\
I'll show you the mountains for a second because it seems similar to what you're doing\
but after I'll show you other things which, for me, are more important than looking at drawings.\
I think that the mountains...\
*The portraits are also nice*\
Okay we'll take a look at the portraits\
So these are experiments, experimentations that I constantly make.\
I'm always trying out things, often I make discoveries\
Like, I work on a code snippet that allows me to make something, and then I apply it to other things that aren't [exactly the same] for instance.\
If I develop an iOS application and I stumble upon an idea, not something that I'll want to sell but that I want to try, I do it anyway, and often it becomes super interesting things, and often that's what brings super interesting things in life.\
All of this for me, it's not usually that direct, like the apps that I make don't put me in contact with interesting people, but these things will.\
Like this, I'm going to present it to the Contemporary Art Museum, because there was someone that was like "hey, this fits with our exhibition, it's cool". I just make this on the side to kill time.
These are faces that I made with an algorithm, I'm going to explain how I did it after\
I used that to make...\
Well actually it's a derivative from another project that uses -- that oops -- that's like mountains, we'll get to them\
So I had a phase where I was making tons of mountains because, I don't know it's rad.\
So I was making things like these.\
This is made with er, it's mostly made by code but, how could I explain this\
*what's clear is that it's not a photograph*\
No it's not a photograph, they're mountains that I generated with a code snipped that allowed, that allowed me to create fractals.\
It's a thing I developed for a completely different usage but I realized that it produced something super beautiful and I was really having fun looking at it.\
And what's interesting is that a bit like the world, the game that I showed you earlier where you can just walk infinitely, I can generate infinite amounts of these, it's a webpage, I just hit refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh and I get new ones, new mountains constantly.\
There's kind of a paradigm shift in art recently, especially in development, it's, instead of typing something by hand, like doing these by hand would be really boring, but, what's interesting now is that you can kind of look for something.\
The job of a human being as an artist is less and less to create something by making brush strokes, but it is to find.
There are so many cool things out there that exist in algorithms that the job of a human is to find the beauty within all this junk
Yes?\
*do you have a deep knowledge of mathematics?*\
No, actually I was initially producing music and gradually I realized, programming musn't be so hard, and if programming isn't hard, and it's the thing, tell yourself--\
Oh come on now! I saw your air-quotes\
No it's, seriously, programming is super scary, especially for artists, when I started I was like, I saw, like when I didn't understand what it was I saw it like a super abstract fucked-up thing that only people that went to school can do, especially in my case I had a kind of frustration against prople that were going to school.\
And no, programming, tell yourself that people that know how to program in the future, they'll be the elite that can, communicate with machines, it's like er, it's awesome, it's not boring excel documents, there's something really beautiful in programming and if you're studying art, you're all going to program.\
Like er, if you go and work in a big studio, you'll end up like, you'll have to make rendering systems and stuff like that, and it's all programming. If you do animation, you'll end up rigging which is all programmed.\
But it's, it's--\
Programming is not necessarily filling up text documents\
There are programming systems that are really cool, what I use is, er\
Ah that's my new computer, crap, I don't have it\
But there's a thing that's called Pure Data, and it's visual programming, it's accessible, it's like a good first step for people who are afraid of programming text files,\
It allows you do make a bunch of stuff like that, and it's going more and more in that direction, I think\
Especially for making 3D, node-based languages.\
